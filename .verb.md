**Why a Bitbucket URL parser library?**

Cuz I needed it. And I really liked parse-github-url's simplicity. So now you have this. Have fun.

(`parse-vcs-url` you say? nahhh, that's way too few `require`s) 

## Usage

```js
var bb = require('{%= name %}');
bb('https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston');
```

Results in:

```js
{
  "owner": "jespern",
  "name": "django-piston",
  "repo": "jespern/django-piston",
  "branch": "master"
}
```

## Example results

Generated results from test fixtures:

```js
{%= renderExamples("support.js") %}
```

## History

**v0.1.1**

First published version.

**v0.1.0**

Basic version, based on parse-github-url.

Note: it is impossible to find out what branch a commit is part of in Bitbucket. Even if a link incldues "at=stable" in
its query string, the actual branch might be wp-pygments-syn or default, etc. For now, we'll just play dumb and imagine 
that at= always works and isn't just cosmetic.
Also note: tags and branches are treated alike in Bitbucket and cannot be distinguished by URL.
We'll treat everything like branches.
